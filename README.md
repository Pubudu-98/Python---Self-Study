## Python Theories Explained & Demonstrated in This Repository

This repository is organized to help you learn and apply key Python programming concepts through hands-on coding. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the theories youâ€™ll find, each linked to practical code examples:

1. **Hello World**
   - *File:* [`Hello_World.py`](Hello_World.py)
   - *Theory:* Introduction to Python syntax and the `print()` function.

2. **Basic Operations**
   - *File:* [`basic_operations.py`](basic_operations.py)
   - *Theory:* Arithmetic operations, variable usage, string concatenation, and user input handling.

3. **Collections (Lists, Tuples, Sets)**
   - *File:* [`collections.py`](collections.py)
   - *Theory:* Pythonâ€™s built-in collection types:  
     - **Lists:** Mutable, ordered sequences.  
     - **Tuples:** Immutable, ordered sequences.  
     - **Sets:** Mutable, unordered collections of unique items.
   - Demonstrates appending, removing, and converting between collection types.

4. **Conditional Statements & Loops**
   - *File:* [`conditional_statements.py`](conditional_statements.py)
   - *Theory:* Decision-making using `if`, `elif`, `else`; logical and comparison operators; and control flow using loops (`for`, `while`), including `break` and `continue`.

5. **Dictionaries**
   - *File:* [`dictionaries.py`](dictionaries.py)
   - *Theory:* Storing and manipulating key-value pairs; creating, accessing, adding, deleting, and iterating over dictionary items.

6. **File Handling**
   - *File:* [`file_handling.py`](file_handling.py)
   - *Theory:* Reading from and writing to files, file modes, and the use of context managers for safe file operations.

7. **Functions**
   - *File:* [`functions.py`](functions.py)
   - *Theory:* Function definition using `def`, parameters, return values, variable scope, calling functions, passing arguments, and best practices.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - *File:* [`objects_classes.py`](objects_classes.py)
   - *Theory:* Introduction to classes and objects in Python. Shows how to define a class, use constructors and methods, instantiate objects, and call their methods.
