- **File:** [`basic_operations.py`](basic_operations.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
  - Working with numbers and variables
  - Basic data types

### 3. Collections
- **File:** [`collections.py`](collections.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Lists, tuples, and sets
  - Basic collection manipulations (adding, removing, iterating)
  - Useful built-in methods

### 4. Conditional Statements
- **File:** [`conditional_statements.py`](conditional_statements.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
  - Comparison and logical operators
  - Branching logic in code

### 5. Dictionaries
- **File:** [`dictionaries.py`](dictionaries.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Creating and using dictionaries
  - Accessing, adding, and deleting key-value pairs
  - Iterating through dictionaries

### 6. Functions
- **File:** [`functions.py`](functions.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Defining and calling functions
  - Function arguments and return values
  - Scope and basic best practices

### 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

- Introduced the basics of OOP in Python, explaining the concepts of classes and objects.
- Added example code for defining a simple class (`Car`) with properties (`make`, `model`, `year`) and a method (`details`).
- Demonstrated how to create objects (instances) of the `Car` class and call their methods.
- Comments and example syntax for class structure and object instantiation were included.
