## Repository Structure & Concepts Covered

### 1. Hello World
- **File:** [`Hello_World.py`](Hello_World.py)
- **Concept:** The traditional starting point for learning any language. This file demonstrates how to print output in Python.

### 2. Basic Operations
- **File:** [`basic_operations.py`](basic_operations.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
  - Working with numbers and variables
  - Basic data types

### 3. Collections
- **File:** [`collections.py`](collections.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Lists, tuples, and sets
  - Basic collection manipulations (adding, removing, iterating)
  - Useful built-in methods

### 4. Conditional Statements
- **File:** [`conditional_statements.py`](conditional_statements.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - `if`, `elif`, `else` statements
  - Comparison and logical operators
  - Branching logic in code

### 5. Dictionaries
- **File:** [`dictionaries.py`](dictionaries.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Creating and using dictionaries
  - Accessing, adding, and deleting key-value pairs
  - Iterating through dictionaries

### 6. Functions
- **File:** [`functions.py`](functions.py)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Defining and calling functions
  - Function arguments and return values
  - Scope and basic best practices

### 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

- Introduced the basics of OOP in Python, explaining the concepts of classes and objects.
- Added example code for defining a simple class (`Car`) with properties (`make`, `model`, `year`) and a method (`details`).
- Demonstrated how to create objects (instances) of the `Car` class and call their methods.
- Comments and example syntax for class structure and object instantiation were included.

## Python Theories Explained & Demonstrated in This Repository

This repository is organized to help you learn and apply key Python programming concepts through hands-on coding. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the theories youâ€™ll find, with each linked to practical scripts demonstrating them:

1. **Hello World**
   - *File:* [`Hello_World.py`](Hello_World.py)
   - *Theory:* Introduction to Python syntax and the `print()` function, the foundation of Python output.

2. **Basic Operations**
   - *File:* [`basic_operations.py`](basic_operations.py)
   - *Theory:* Covers arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, floor division), variable usage, string concatenation, and user input handling. Also includes a simple exercise involving user-driven computations.

3. **Collections (Lists, Tuples, Sets)**
   - *File:* [`collections.py`](collections.py)
   - *Theory:* Explains Pythonâ€™s built-in collection types:
     - **Lists:** Mutable, ordered sequences (add, remove, access by index).
     - **Tuples:** Immutable, ordered sequences.
     - **Sets:** Mutable, unordered collections of unique items.
   - Practical manipulations such as appending, removing, and converting collections are demonstrated.

4. **Conditional Statements & Loops**
   - *File:* [`conditional_statements.py`](conditional_statements.py)
   - *Theory:* Teaches decision-making with `if`, `elif`, and `else`; logical and comparison operators; and control flow using loops (`for`, `while`). Also covers `break` and `continue` usage, and includes exercises like a number-guessing game to solidify the concepts.

5. **Dictionaries**
   - *File:* [`dictionaries.py`](dictionaries.py)
   - *Theory:* Highlights the use of dictionaries for storing key-value pairs. Demonstrates creating, accessing, adding, deleting, and iterating over dictionary items.

6. **Functions**
   - *File:* [`functions.py`](functions.py)
   - *Theory:* Introduces function definition using `def`, parameters, return values, and variable scope. Shows how to call functions, pass arguments, and apply best practices. Exercises include writing custom functions for greetings, addition, and area calculation.

7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - *File:* [`objects_classes.py`](objects_classes.py)
   - *Theory:* Explains class and object concepts in Python. Demonstrates how to define a class with a constructor, properties, and methods (such as the `Car` example), instantiate objects, and call their methods. All code is commented for clarity and learning.
